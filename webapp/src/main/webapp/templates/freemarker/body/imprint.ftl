	<p> <strong>Exemption from liability <br /></strong>Those responsible at Osnabrück University have compiled the information contained on this website with the greatest of care. Nevertheless, Osnabrück University cannot assume any liability for the topicality, correctness, completeness or quality of the information and data provided.
</p>
	<p> For this reason, no liability claims can be made against Osnabrück University, those responsible for this website or the authors of the respective articles for material or immaterial damages caused by potentially inaccurate or incomplete information and data, unless there is intent or gross negligence involved.
</p>
	<p> This also applies to information on websites to which we refer via a hyperlink. At the time of linking, the content was free of any illegal content. Osnabrück University has absolutely no influence on the design of the linked websites. Constant monitoring of the content of the linked sites is unreasonable without concrete evidence of unlawful content. The content of these websites is therefore entirely outside the responsibility of Osnabrück University. Osnabrück University does not adopt the content of the linked websites as its own. Osnabrück University, those responsible for this website and the authors shall not assume liability for any damages resulting from inaccurate or incomplete content on websites referred to by a link.
</p>
<p><strong>Liability for contents</strong><br />The contents of our website have been put together with the greatest care. However, we assume no liability for the correctness, completeness and up-to-dateness of the contents provided. As a public body, we are responsible under § 7 subsection 1 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG) for ensuring that our contents on this website comply with general legislation. However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are under no obligation to monitor transmitted or recorded information from external sources, nor are we liable to search for circumstances that may suggest illicit activity. Obligations to eliminate or bar the use of information based on general legislation remain unaffected by the aforementioned. Liability in this regard only comes into effect once a concrete infringement has been acknowledged. Contents in breach of law that become known to us will be removed immediately.   <br /><br /><strong>Liability for links   <br /></strong> Our posts contain links to external websites of third parties. We have no influence on the contents of such websites. We therefore cannot assume any liability for the contents of these external websites. Responsibility for the contents of linked websites rests exclusively with the respective provider or operator thereof. The linked websites were checked for possible violations of the law at the time of creating the link. No unlawful contents were recognized at the time. Permanent monitoring of the contents of the linked sites is infeasible, however, without concrete evidence of unlawful content. On becoming aware of any such legal infringement, we will remove the links in question immediately.

	<p><strong>Copyright<br /></strong>The contents and material prepared by the website operator and published on this website are subject to German copyright. The content provided on this website may only be reproduced, edited, distributed or exploited in any way beyond the scope of copyright law if written consent is given by the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this website are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Unless the contents of this website have been put together by the operator himself, they may be subject to the copyright of third parties. Contents by third parties are identified as such. Nevertheless, if you should become aware of any copyright violation, please inform us accordingly. Should such legal violations become known to us, we will remove the contents in question immediately.</p>
